# ## Why evaluate models?

# ### Science is about building models
# 
# > A central goal of science is building **models** of the world. This includes verbal explanations but also and especially **statistical models**. 
# 
# Typically, we want our models to be:
# 
# - **Accurate**: they should be a good description of the data.
# - **Parsimonious**: they shouldn't be more complicated than they need to be.

# ### Many *possible* models
# 
# > Given any dataset $d$, there are many *possible* models $m_1, m_2, ..., m_n$ we could build of that dataset.
# 
# Which model is "best"?
# 
# - Here, "best" is always relative to some goal. 
#    - Best at predicting $Y$?  
#    - Most theoeretically interesting?
# - This process of selecting the best model is called **model selection**.

# ### *Comparing* models
# 
# > In order to select the best model, researchers often **compare** multiple models in terms of their predictive power.
# 
# These model comparison approaches typically incorporate:
# 
# 1. A measure of **accuracy**: how well do $m_1$ vs. $m_2$ fit the data, $d$?
# 2. A measure of **complexity**: how complex are $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively?

# ### Review: evaluating linear models
# 
# We've already discussed several approaches to evaluating and comparing **linear regression models**:
# 
# - $R^2$: what proportion of variance in $Y$ is explained by $X$?  
# - $Adj. R^2$: what proportion of variance in $Y$ is explained by $X$, adjusting for $n$ and $p$?
# - $MSE$: how much *squared error* does our model of $Y$ typically have? 
# 
# In combination with **cross-validation**, these techniques allow us to compare the **accuracy** of models while also penalizing **over-fitting**.

# ### Bias-variance trade-off revisited
# 
# - Red line = test error.
# - Blue line = train error.

# ## Evaluating classifiers: metrics
# 
# Today, we'll be focusing on evaluating **classification models**.
# 
# - Some of these metrics also apply to linear models, like AIC.  
# - But others (like [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)) are limited to *categorical* data.

# ### Loading the dataset

# In[3]:


df_spam = pd.read_csv("data/models/classification/email.csv")
df_spam.head(2)


# ### Accuracy
# 
# > The **accuracy** of a model is the number of **correct predictions** divided by the total number of observations.
# 
# $Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $TP$: True positive.
# - $TN$: True negative.
# - $FP$: False positive.
# - $FN$: False negative.

# #### Assessing accuracy
# 
# A straightforward way to assess accuracy is to simply compare the **true labels**, $Y$, to the **predicted labels**, $\hat{Y}$.

# In[4]:


true_labels = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
predicted_labels = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
correct_response = true_labels == predicted_labels
correct_response


# In[5]:


### Accuracy
correct_response.mean()


# #### Using `accuracy_score`
# 
# The `accuracy_score` function in `sklearn` will do this for you.

# In[6]:


from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


# In[7]:


accuracy_score(true_labels, predicted_labels)


# #### But where do the predictions come from?
# 
# Many models, such as logistic regression, produce a **probability** of the outcome, i.e., $p(spam)$. 
# 
# How would you convert $p(spam)$ to an actual **prediction**, i.e., `spam` vs. `not spam`?
# 
# - This requires **thresholding** your probability score at a certain value of $p$.  
#    - If $p_i > t$: `spam`.  
#    - If $p_i â‰¤ t$: `not spam`.

# #### Naive approach: threshold at $p = .5$
# 
# A naive approach is to create a **threshold** at $p = .5$.

# In[8]:


predicted_probability = np.array([.6, .2, .7, .7, .4, .55])
predicted_labels = (predicted_probability > .5).astype(int)
predicted_labels


# In[9]:


accuracy_score(predicted_labels, true_labels)


# #### Check-in
# 
# Can anyone think of any potential issues with this naive threshold of $p_t = .5$?

# #### The importance of thresholding
# 
# Depending on the **base rate** of $Y$ in your dataset, $p_t = .5$ might generate either:
# 
# - Too many false positives.  
# - Too many false negatives.

# #### Thresholding in practice (pt. 1)
# 
# What do we notice about the **distribution** of predicted probabilities from our model predicting `spam`?

# In[10]:


## Fit a model
mod_spam = smf.logit(data = df_spam, formula = "spam ~ winner + num_char + re_subj").fit()
## Get predictions
y_pred = mod_spam.predict()
## Visualize predicted probabilities
sns.histplot(x = y_pred, alpha = .5)
plt.axvline(x = .5, linestyle = "dotted")


# #### Thresholding in practice (pt. 2)
# 
# - If we use $p_t = .5$, then we classify very few instances as `spam`.
# - Though because `spam` is relatively rare, we actuall have decently high accuracy...

# In[11]:


labels_t5 = y_pred > .5
print("Proportion classified as spam: {x}".format(x = round(labels_t5.mean(), 4)))
print("Proportion actual spam: {x}".format(x = round(df_spam['spam'].mean(), 4)))
print("Accuracy: {x}".format(x = round(accuracy_score(labels_t5, df_spam['spam']), 2)))


# #### Thresholding in practice (pt. 3)
# 
# - We can also test out different **thresholds** to see how accuracy scales with $p_t$.
# - **Note**: keep in mind that it also matters **how** the model is going wrong...

# In[12]:


results = []
for t in np.arange(0, 1, .01):
    labels = y_pred > t
    accuracy = accuracy_score(labels, df_spam['spam'])
    results.append({'accuracy': accuracy, 't': t, 'pred_spam': labels.mean()})


# In[13]:


df_results = pd.DataFrame(results)
sns.lineplot(data = df_results, x = "t", y = "accuracy", label = "Accuracy")
sns.lineplot(data = df_results, x = "t", y = "pred_spam", label = "Predicted Spam")


# #### Check-in
# 
# Relating to thresholding: are there any issues with just naively using accuracy?

# #### The problem of "naive accuracy"
# 
# Depending on the **base rate** of $Y$, *very high accuracy* could be achieved by simply always guessing the same thing.
# 
# - If fraud is very rare ($p(Y) = .01$), then always guessing `not fraud` will yield $99\%$ accuracy.  
# - However, it also means you'd **miss** every real instance of `fraud`.
# 
# This raises the issue of [Type 1 vs. Type 2 errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors).

# ### Type 1 vs. Type 2 Errors
# 
# Models can be [wrong in *different ways*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors).
# 
# - A **Type 1 Error** is *incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis*, i.e., a **false positive**.  
# - A **Type 2 Error** is *incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis*, i.e., a **false negative**.
# 
# | |predicted label = `not spam`|predicted label = `spam`|
# |--|-----------------------|-------------------
# |true label = `not spam`| Correct (True Negative) | False Positive |
# |true label = `spam` | False Negative | Correct (True Positive) |

# #### Review: Different errors have different *costs*

# 

# #### Calculating the *false positive rate*
# 
# > The **false positive rate** is the proportion of *negative classes* (e.g., `not spam`) incorrectly categorized as a *positive class* (e.g., `spam`).
# 
# $FPR = \frac{FP}{N}$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $FP$: The number of false positives.  
# - $N$: The number of *negative* classes.

# ##### Demo: FPR

# In[14]:


## Demo: true data
true_labels = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
## Demo: predicted labels
predicted_labels = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])


# In[15]:


## Number of true negatives
N = len(true_labels[true_labels==0])
## Number of FP
FP = len(predicted_labels[(predicted_labels==1) & (true_labels == 0)])


# In[16]:


## FP Rate
FP / N


# #### Calculating the *false negative rate*
# 
# > The **false negative rate** is the proportion of *positive classes* (e.g., `spam`) incorrectly categorized as a *negative class* (e.g., `not spam`).
# 
# $FNR = \frac{FN}{P}$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $FN$: The number of false negatives.  
# - $P$: The number of *positive* classes.

# ##### Demo: FNR

# In[17]:


## Demo: true data
true_labels = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
## Demo: predicted labels
predicted_labels = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])


# In[18]:


## Number of true negatives
P = len(true_labels[true_labels==1])
## Number of FP
FN = len(predicted_labels[(predicted_labels==0) & (true_labels == 1)])


# In[19]:


## FP Rate
FN / P


# #### Coming up: confusion matrices
# 
# Soon, we'll discuss how to build a **confusion matrix**, which contains information about the false positive and false negative rates, as below:
# 
# | |predicted label = `not spam`|predicted label = `spam`|
# |--|-----------------------|-------------------
# |true label = `not spam`| Correct (True Negative) | False Positive |
# |true label = `spam` | False Negative | Correct (True Positive) |

# ### Precision vs. Recall
# 
# > [**Precision** and **Recall**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) are finer-grained measures of a model's performance that account for false positives and false negatives. 
# 
# - **Precision**: what proportion of items classified as `spam` are actually `spam`?
# - **Recall**: what proportion of actual `spam` was successfully recognized as `spam`? 
# 
# 
# 

# ![title](img/recall.png)
# 
# [Image source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)

# #### Calculating precision
# 
# $Precision = \frac{TP}{P*} = 1 - FPR$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $TP$: How many true positives?  
# - $P*$: How many predicted positives?

# In[20]:


from sklearn.metrics import precision_score


# In[21]:


true_labels = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
predicted_labels = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
precision_score(true_labels, predicted_labels)


# #### Calculating recall
# 
# $Recall = \frac{TP}{P} = 1 - FNR$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $TP$: How many true positives?  
# - $P*$: How many actual positives?

# In[22]:


from sklearn.metrics import recall_score


# In[23]:


true_labels = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
predicted_labels = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
recall_score(true_labels, predicted_labels)


# ### Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
# 
# > **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** is a measure of *model fit* that factors in both the **accuracy** of the model and the **complexity** of the model.
# 
# $AIC = 2k - 2*log(\mathcal{L})$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $k$: number of parameters (predictors) in the model.  
# - $\mathcal{L}$: the **likelihood** of the model.

# #### What is "likelihood"?
# 
# > The **likelihood** of a model is a measure of the *probability* of the data, given the model.
# 
# - Recall that a model $M$ is a model of the **data-generating process**.  
# - Likelihood is a way of asking:
#    - If $M$ generated predictions $\hat{Y}$ from input $X$...
#    - ...How *similar* are these predictions to the actual data, $Y$}?
#    
# What does this remind you of?

# #### Likelihood vs. $RSS$
# 
# The **residual sum of squares** ($RSS$) measures:
# 
# $RSS = \sum_i^N{(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$
# 
# **Likelihood** is technically a *generalization* of this approach:
# 
# $\mathcal{L(X | \theta)} = \prod_i^Np(y_i | \theta)$
# 
# Where:
# 
# - $\theta$: the parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_n$.  
# - $p(y_i | \theta)$: the probability of an actual observation, $y_i$, given the model parameters $\theta$.

# #### Extracting and interpreting AIC
# 
# - The actual $AIC$ number won't mean much, as it depends on the variance in the data, $N$, and more (similar to $MSE$).
# - $AIC$ is primarily useful for comparing different models. 
# - A **lower** $AIC$ is better.

# In[24]:


m1 = smf.logit(data = df_spam, formula = "spam ~ num_char").fit()
m2 = smf.logit(data = df_spam, formula = "spam ~ winner").fit()


# In[25]:


print(m1.aic)
print(m2.aic)


# #### $AIC$ in practice
# 
# Typically, $AIC$ is **rescaled** by subtracting the $AIC$ of the best model (i.e., the lowest $AIC$ value) from each of the $AIC$ values in question.
# 
# - Thus, the *best* model has a rescaled $AIC$ of `0`.
# - The rescaled $AIC$ value reflects the **difference** from the best model.

# In[26]:


rescaled = np.array([m1.aic, m2.aic]) - m1.aic
rescaled


# ## Evaluating models with *visualizations*
# 
# Beyond **metrics**, we can evaluate models by making visualizations about their predictive success. We'll focus on:
# 
# - Confusion matrix.  
# - ROC Curve.

# ### Confusion matrix
# 
# > A **confusion matrix** compares a model's predictions to actual values of $Y$, allowing a viewer to determine which classes were most frequently "confused" (i.e., where the **error rate** was highest).
# 
# 
# | |predicted label = `not spam`|predicted label = `spam`|
# |--|-----------------------|-------------------
# |true label = `not spam`| Correct (True Negative) | False Positive |
# |true label = `spam` | False Negative | Correct (True Positive) |

# #### Confusion matrix in practice
# 
# `sklearn` has a `confusion_matrix` function, which takes as input the true labels (`y_true`) and the predicted labels (`y_pred`).
# 
# To interpret the output:
# 
# - The **rows** refer to the *real labels* of $Y$.  
# - The **columns** refer to the *predicted labels*, $\hat{Y}$.
# - The **diagonal** of the matrix are the correct responses.
#    - Ideally, all other cells should be *zero*: no errors.
# - Each **cell** thus refers to the intersection:
#    - How many times did we predict `0` when it was actually a `1`?
#    - How many times did we predict `1` when it was actually a `0`?

# #### Check-in
# 
# Based on this confusion matrix, what is the number of:
# 
# - True positives?  
# - False positives? 
# - True negatives?  
# - False negatives?

# In[27]:


from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix


# In[28]:


cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predicted_labels)
cm


# #### Normalizing our output
# 
# We can also **normalize** the output using the `normalize = 'true'` parameter.
# 
# Based on this confusion matrix, what is our **false positive rate**? What about our **false negative rate**?

# In[29]:


cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predicted_labels, normalize = 'true')
cm


# #### Visualizing with `seaborn`
# 
# We can use `seaborn.heatmap` to visualize the output of a confusion matrix.

# In[30]:


sns.heatmap(cm, annot = True)


# ### ROC Curve
# 
# > A **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve** illustrates the ability of a binary classifier to discriminate between classes as its **threshold** ($p_t$) is adjusted.
# 
# - x-axis: false positive rate for a given threshold.  
# - y-axis: true positive rate for a given threshold.
# 
# ![title](img/roc.png)
# 

# #### Check-in
# 
# If $p_t = 0$ (i.e., everything with $p_i â‰¥ 0$ is labeled `spam`), what should our **false positive rate** and **true positive rate** be?

# #### Solution
# 
# When $p_t = 0$ (i.e., everything with $p_i â‰¥ 0$ is labeled `spam`):
# 
# - Our true positive rate will be $100\%$: we never miss an instance of `spam`. 
# - Our false positive rate will also be $100\%$: we classify every instance of `not spam` as `spam`.

# #### ROC Curve in practice
# 
# Steps involved in building an ROC Curve:
# 
# 1. Fit a classifier to your data, and extract predicted probabilities $p_i$.  
# 2. Consider a **range** of thresholds of $p_t$, from $[0, 1]$. 
# 3. For each threshold, calculate the **false positive rate (FPR)** and **true positive rate (TPR)**.  
# 4. Plot `TPR ~ FPR` and compare to random performance.  
# 5. (Optional) Calculate the **area under the curve** (AUC) between the classifier performance and random chance.

# #### Step 1: Fit a model

# In[31]:


model = smf.logit(data = df_spam, formula = "spam ~ winner + num_char + re_subj").fit()
y_pred = model.predict()


# In[32]:


p = plt.hist(y_pred,alpha = .5)
plt.xlabel("Predicted p(spam)")


# #### Step 2: Consider a range of thresholds

# In[33]:


thresholds = np.arange(0, 1, .01)
true_labels = df_spam['spam']


# #### Step 3: Calculate FPR and TPR

# In[34]:


results = []
for t in thresholds:
    predicted_labels = y_pred > t
    
    ## Calculate confusion matrix
    cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predicted_labels, normalize = 'true')
    
    ## Extract FPR and TPR
    fpr = cm[0, 1]
    tpr = cm[1, 1]
    
    results.append({'tpr': tpr, 'fpr': fpr})


# #### Step 4: Visualize

# In[35]:


df_results = pd.DataFrame(results)
sns.lineplot(data = df_results, x = "fpr", y = "tpr")
sns.lineplot(data = df_results, x = "fpr", y = "fpr", linestyle = "dotted", color = "red")


# #### Why ROC curve is useful
# 
# In principle, we can plot the ROC curve for **multiple models**.  
# 
# - This gives us a clear way to visualize the relative rate of **false positives** and **true positives** for different models.  
# - Depending on whether we're worried more about FPR or TPR, this may help us decide which model is best.

# #### `roc_curve` in `sklearn`
# 
# We can also use the `roc_curve` function in `sklearn` to build an **ROC Curve** much more easily!
# 
# ```python
# roc_curve(y_true, y_score)
# ```
# 
# This returns the `fpr`, `tpr`, and `thresholds` used.

# In[36]:


from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve


# In[37]:


fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(true_labels, y_pred)
sns.lineplot(x = fpr, y = tpr)
sns.lineplot(x = fpr, y = fpr, linestyle = "dotted")


# ## Conclusion
# 
# - Once we've built a statistical model, we need to **evaluate** it.  
# - There are many approaches to evaluating models, but we've discussed a few:
#    - Using **metrics** like accuracy, precision/recall, and $AIC$.
#    - Using **visualization techniques** like a confusion matrix and ROC Curve.
